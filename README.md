# Probabilities Engine
This engine provides **useful concepts** regarding **probabilities concepts** like:
* partially generating the common repartition of two random variables 
* completing the common repartition 
* calculating the marginal repartition
* calculating the covariance
* calculating the conditional probability
* checking if the variables are independent or uncorrelated
* an idea for managing the common repartition for three random variables
* checking the integral condition of Fubini and calculating the double integral

Using the **Shiny Package**, the engine **plots**:
* the probability distribution for a random variable
* the probability distribution for two random variables
* the distribution function for a random variable
* the distribution function for two random variables
